# Proposal {.unnumbered}

> For our project, we plan on analyzing March Madness Data from the years 2008-2023 (excluding 2020), trying to see how far each team went in the tournament based on their power ranking in order to see if there are any trends. March Madness is an end of season collegeiate basketball tournmanet that takes place each year. It is noteable because millions of people try and predict the winner, which is a tall task. 
Along side the primary dataset, there supplemental datsets on kaggle that we could join to further the scope of our research project as we go. 
The supplemental dataset that we joined with the March Madness Data is the cbb data set. This data set includes more information about each time like conference, wins, shooting percentage etc.
