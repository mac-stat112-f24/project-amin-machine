> 3 Point Percentage by Conference
  - The conferences included in the plot are all part of the Power 5 with the exception of the BE. As shown by the boxplots, all conferences have a similar 3 point percentage with the exception of the SEC as an outlier. However they still stand at the top 6 of win percentages across all conferences because they focus on defense and getting to the rim. This trend is shown in a plot depicting the offensive rebounds and defensive efficiency across the several top conferences, including the Power 5. 
  
> Defensive Efficiency 
  - The defensive efficiency is calculated by points allowed per 100 possessions so the lower the efficiency the better. The scatter plot shows a strong negative correlation between defensive effiency and wins. This shows that the better the defensive efficiency usually results in a win. We can see that the SEC has one of the best defensive effiencies which makes up for the lower 3 point percentage. 
  
> 3 Point % Impact on Wins 
  - These plots illustrate a somewhat strong positive correlation between wins and 3 point percentage. This goes to show that a high 3 point percentage is a big part of wiinning games. However as shown in later plots this is not the only fator that contributes to wins. 
  
> In the plots, we are mainly obeserving the Power 5 (ACC, B10, B12, P12, SEC) because those teams tend to be the most successful in the tournament. The Power 5 conferences are arguably the 5 most prominent and influential in D1 college sports. However there is a lot of controversy around the term because of the fluctuating success and other outlying conferences. Some outlying conferences include the BE because their success is inconsistent.
