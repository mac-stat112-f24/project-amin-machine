# Predicting March Madness Success

We used **R Studio** version 4.4.1 in the construction of our project, as well as the packages **dplyr** version 1.3.1 and **tidyverse** version 2.0.0. 
Both of the data sets we used were downloaded from **kaggle**, with the first being titled March Madness Data, by author Nishaan Amin, and the second being titled College Basketball Dataset, by author Andrew Sundberg.
