In the anaylsis of NCAA March Madness performance, we are mainly obeserving the Power 5 (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, SEC) because those teams tend to be the most successful in the tournament. The Power 5 conferences are arguably the 5 most prominent and influential in D1 college sports. However there is a lot of controversy around the term because of the fluctuating success and other outlying conferences. Some outlying conferences include the Big East, which is included in our data visualization, because they challenge the dominance of the Power 5.
